  <h1> Who am I? </h1>
  
  A future graduate of ISAE-SUPAERO, I'd like to put my knowledge of Data Science to work on <b>impact projects</b>.
  By "impact projects", I'm referring in particular to projects aimed at solving current <b>environmental issues</b> or improving the <b>quality of life for everyone</b> (health, education, etc.).
  <br>
  
  Having also followed Master 2 courses in Deep Learning in Singapore (NUS), I've already been able to apply my knowledge in practical cases through <b>two internships</b> as well as personal projects.
  In particular, I carried out a personal project to <a href="https://pierre-phu-en.github.io/2022-11-15-shark/">protect sharks</a> (and surfers) in Australia. <br>
  <br>

  If my friends had to describe me in two words, they'd use <b>"curious"</b> and <b>"creative"</b>.
  I actually like to spend some of my free time solving everyday problems, typically at my school's Fablab when I was there.
  I think the <b>constraints</b> (material, physical, etc.) in a problem push me to be <b>creative</b> in finding the best solution, and that's probably why I always wanted to be an engineer.<br>
  
  <h1> What's the point of this website?</h1>


  I sometimes carry out certain personal projects in my spare time.
  They're not necessarily relevant on a 
  <a href="https://pierre-phu-en.github.io/assets/img/PHU_Pierre_Resume.pdf">Resume</a>,
  but they're still part of my daily life.
  On this site, you can find out more about the various
  <a href="https://pierre-phu-en.github.io/projets">projects</a> I've carried out both during and outside my school career.

  <h1> So enjoy your reading! </h1>
